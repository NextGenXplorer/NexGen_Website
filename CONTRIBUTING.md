# Contributing

First off, thank you for considering contributing to this project. It's people like you that make this project such a great tool.

Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing this open source project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.

## How Can I Contribute?

There are many ways to contribute, from writing tutorials or blog posts, improving the documentation, submitting bug reports and feature requests or writing code which can be incorporated into the project itself.

## Ground Rules

- Ensure cross-platform compatibility for every change that's accepted.
- Create issues for any major changes and enhancements that you wish to make. Discuss things transparently and get community feedback.
- Be welcoming to newcomers and encourage diverse new contributors from all backgrounds. See our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Your First Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing? You can start by looking through issues labeled `good first issue`.

Working on your first Pull Request? You can learn how from this *free* series, [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/series/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github).

## Getting Started

For something that is bigger than a one or two line fix:

1. Create your own fork of the code
2. Do the changes in your fork
3. If you like the change and think the project could use it, send a pull request.

## How to Report a Bug

If you find a security vulnerability, do NOT open an issue. Email us instead.

When filing an issue, make sure to answer these five questions:

1. What version of the project are you using?
2. What operating system and processor architecture are you using?
3. What did you do?
4. What did you expect to see?
5. What did you see instead?

## How to Suggest a Feature or Enhancement

If you find yourself wishing for a feature that doesn't exist, you are probably not alone. There are bound to be others out there with similar needs. Open an issue on our issues list on GitHub which describes the feature you would like to see, why you need it, and how it should work.

## Code Review Process

The core team looks at Pull Requests on a regular basis. After feedback has been given we expect responses within two weeks. After two weeks we may close the pull request if it isn't showing any activity.
